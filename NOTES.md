# (design) Notes


## The main pillars:

  - JRPG-style combat
    - does this have to imply a party system?
      - I think it does, yes
  - Wandering monsters
  - Shiren/Azure Dreams style anti-permadeath
  - Crystals
  - Status effects
  - World : Town : Dungeon locations


## Other features / things not to forget

  - Command>Event pattern; Player extends Entity, Entity takes care of Mixins, mixin "Actor" 
  - public website
  - public morgue files
  - I need a name for this thing, and an aesthetic (which is possibly... anime/JPGish)?
 

## A manifesto

First of all, I am going to work on this, and I am going to feel the loss of it when I don't get to. I am going to throw every system, idea and wish-list item of my own into it. I am going to make the roguelike-JRPG that I want to play, and I am going to play it myself. To that end, one of the first things I should implement is *persistence*, so games/characters can be saved and loaded. 

No saving in dungeons. That makes it quicker and easier, but might be seen as lazy?
