CRYSTAL STATUS CHANGELOG
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY to VARIOUS SYMBOLOGIES and MYSTERIOUS MARKS
[!] New or important features, content
[+] Changes to existing features or content
[-] Code tweaks, bug fixes, miscellany
[?] Arcane and unsolved puzzles, disturbed thoughts

A NOTE on VERSIONING and DATES
CRYSTAL STATUS is an on-going, living project and as such code and content is not so much released
as birthed screaming. There are no version numbers; just dates, which are presented in the ISO 8601 
format: yyyy-mm-dd. Maybe one day there will be version numbers. For now consider this 0.x.x-dev

## TO DO / COMING SOON (probably) / THINGS TO REMEMBER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[-] Entity type flag -- done but needs populating
[-] Doors should probably be entities instead of tiles
[-] Per-entity getTile() implementation for better pathfinding
[-] Fishing minigame (the most important feature)


## Week commencing 2019-03-11
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[+] UIMenu and UIStateManager can now create menus with arrow key / number key / escape controls
[-] Rewrote "subscreen" CSS and UIStateManager to handle non-fullscreen UI overlays


## Week commencing 2019-03-04
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[!] Coins no longer block movement for Entities without the CanPickupCoins mixin
[+] Entities can now be in a stack on a tile, so rats can occupy the same tile as coins
[+] A small number of water tiles are now generated
[+] Floor tiles now have a randomised mottling effect to break up blocks of colour, looks quite nice

[!] Tentatively picked the name CRYSTAL STATUS, for reasons that may become apparent eventually
[!] Started this CHANGELOG, because friends don't let friends use commit messages as a changelog
[!] NPC class, and therefore: rats! Rats! Rats everywhere! They're dumb as rocks, but they exist.
[!] Player can open doors and pick up coins. The rats can do neither.
[!] Title screen, about screen: pretty, but useless. Basically a proof-of-concept right now.
[+] Decided: using a Command design pattern with JS mixins as a ECS "component" substitute
[+] Command pattern: Action class and MoveAction, BumpAction, OpenDoorAction, PickupCoinAction
[+] Mixins for the above actions and corrisponding add|remove|hasMixin methods on Entities
[+] Implemented Engine and Scheduler from ROT.js
[+] Player can now open doors
[+] Pathfinder mixin as a wrapper/enabler of A* pathfinding for Entities 
[+] Coins are scattered around the map, which the player can pick up by stepping on them
[+] Added UIStateManager to switch views and keybindings based on UI state
[-] Refactored a bunch of stuff in a bunch of places
[-] Many, many CSS tweaks
[-] Experiments with pre-generated ASCII art
